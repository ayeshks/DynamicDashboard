# React + Vite Project

This project is a minimal setup to get a React application working with Vite, including support for Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized builds.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher is recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

### 2. Run the Development Server

Start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:

- Start the Vite development server.
- Enable Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for live updates as you modify your code.
- The app will be available at the URL shown in your terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

### 3. Build for Production

To create a production build of your application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:

- Generate an optimized production build in the `dist/` folder.

### 4. Preview the Build

You can preview the production build locally using:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This command will serve the files in the `dist/` folder at a local server for preview purposes.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally.
